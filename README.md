# UIRD: Underwater Image Retrieval Dataset

##Data Sources
The images in this dataset are derived from:
- RealA dataset
- UVE-38K dataset 

## Dataset Overview
UIRD is the first benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating **underwater image retrieval** algorithms.

**Key Statistics:**
- **Total Images:** 10,581
- **Categories:** 139 underwater scenes. The first three characters of the image name should be the identification number of the landmark image it belongs to.
- **Training Set:** 7,395 images (72 categories)
- **Test Set:** 3,186 images (67 categories)  
- **Query Set:** 156 images (sampled from test set)
